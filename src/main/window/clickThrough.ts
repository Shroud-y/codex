   * Mouse-move forwarding is charged to the whole machine, not to this window.
   * Electron implements it with a global `WH_MOUSE_LL` hook, so every mouse
   * move on the system is routed through this process's main thread before the
   * pointer moves. Held open for the app's lifetime — which is what passing
   * `forward` at window creation did — the pointer stutters system-wide
   * whenever that thread is busy, most visibly through the launch that builds
   * the window, loads the bank and starts the monitors.
   *
   * Measured with the overlay hidden: 0 ms of main-process CPU over five idle
   * seconds, 78 ms over five seconds of nothing but mouse movement.
   *
   * The forwarded moves are only read while a bubble is up (`App.tsx` uses
   * them to notice the cursor over the dismiss affordance), so the hook goes
   * in with the window and comes out again when it hides.
