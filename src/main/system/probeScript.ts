/**
 * The PowerShell side of the presence probe. Kept as one long-lived process
 * that answers single-word commands on stdin: spawning a shell every 30 s
 * would blow the idle-CPU budget on its own.
 *
 * That budget is why the system and process monitors ask *here* rather than
 * through `systeminformation`. Every one of its Windows queries spawns a cold
 * `powershell.exe` — measured at ~640 ms of CPU each, and the monitors between
 * them were doing nineteen a minute. In this already-running host the same
 * questions answer in 11-18 ms.
 *
 * The P/Invoke lives in `resources/probe/CodexProbe.cs` and is precompiled to
 * `CodexProbe.dll` by `pnpm probe-dll` (§8.5, §21 — still no native module).
 * It used to be compiled here on every launch by an inline `Add-Type`, which
 * cost 14-25 s cold and put all of it inside the login storm; loading the
 * prebuilt assembly takes ~123 ms. The `.cs` is shipped alongside the DLL and
 * compiled as a fallback, so a checkout that never ran the build step still
 * has working fullscreen detection.
 *
 * The script takes the directory holding both as its one parameter.
