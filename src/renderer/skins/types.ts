 * §3.0 — a **persona** is who is speaking: name, phrase bank, voice, colours.
 * A **skin** is what that persona looks like: geometry and motion. Separate
 * axes, so the same character can wear a different body and the same body can
 * be reused by another character with its own palette.
 *
 * A skin never hardcodes a colour. Everything it paints comes from the
 * `palette` it is handed, which is why `paletteOverrides` exists — a skin that
 * genuinely needs a different value states it as data instead of baking it in.
