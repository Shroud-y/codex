 * §3 — the companion is an eye and nothing else. No shell, no frame, no ring:
 * one aperture of rendered light on a transparent ground.
 *
 * That makes this skin a single layer, which is unusual here — the other skins
 * were stacks of five, and the stack existed because each moving part had to
 * be its own composited element or Chromium re-rasterised a filter graph every
 * frame. None of that applies to a canvas: the motion happens inside the
 * shader, so there is nothing for the compositor to animate and nothing to
 * split apart.
 *
 * The eye needs no fallback path. It is the whole character, so a machine that
 * cannot run it has nothing to fall back *to* — see `ShaderEye`.
